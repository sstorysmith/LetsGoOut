Overview:
    Lets Go Out helps to organize an exciting and spontaneous night out on the town.
    Experience all that local nightlife has to offer! Whether it's a dinner and a concert, or catching a movie and some drinks.  
        
App Design:
    Once the DOM is loaded, code begins executing. Location (Zip Code) is set by a call to Google Maps OR an override by the user. Zipcode is used to query the local nightlife and random selections are made based on answered questions. APIs: Eeventbrite, Fandango, Yelp, Google Maps, TMS Movie. A "submit" button will kick off the logic.
    A photo of the venue is displayed:
        If user doesn't like the recommendation presented, there's a "re-roll" button to click.
        If user does like the recommendation, there's a "yelp" button to display reviews. There's also a map displayed of the venue.
    Moments.js is used to set and convert time values.
